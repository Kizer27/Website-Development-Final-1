        <p>
            Undertale is an indie rpg known for its characters and multiple endings. While the game is short and simplistic, it is a misleading great game. What differentiates
            Undertale from most rpgs in the combat system. On the player's turn, not only can they attack, they can also choose to show mercy on the monsters they're fighting.
            This is the basis for the branching, as who you choose to kill and spare has a major impact on how the game plays out.
