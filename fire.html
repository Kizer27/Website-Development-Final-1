        <p>
            Fire Emblem Three Houses is a turn based strategy rpg for the Nintendo Switch. It is a part of the Fire Emblem series, but, like most Fire Emblem games, works as
            a standalone title. You play as a mercenary turned teacher and your students are the units you use in battle. This allows you to train them to fit whatever role you
            need on the battlefield. At the start of the game, you pick one of three houses to join, each with different students. While the first half of the game is similar
            no matter which house you pick, the second half is completely different.
