            Minecraft is an open-world sandbox survival game. Each world is randomly generated, meaning every plathrough is completely different. The main objective is to beat
            the final boss, but ther is a near limitless amount of things you can do along the way. Minecraft also has extensive multiplayer features, which expands the gameplay
            far beyond almost any other game. The multiplayer features has led to tens of thousands of servers each with their own many games to be created, meaning you play any
            genre of game within Minecraft.
